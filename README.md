# AES_for_PHP_5_and_7
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. Also referenced as Rijndael, it is one of the most powerful encryption algorithms available today. Although there are some possible attacks, the algorithm was strong enough to become the first publicly accessible encryption algorithm that was approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for encrypting top secret information. AES encryption is used by U.S. for securing sensitive but unclassified material, so we can say it is enough secure. The algorithm was developed by two Belgian cryptographer Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. AES was designed to be efficient in both hardware and software, and supports a block length of 128 bits and key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
